The International Numbering System for Food Additives (INS) is a European-based
naming system for food additives, aimed at providing a short designation of
what may be a lengthy actual name. It is defined by Codex Alimentarius, the
international food standards organisation of the World Health Organisation (WHO)
and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). The information
is published in the document Class Names and the International Numbering System
for Food Additives, first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011. The INS
is an open list, "subject to the inclusion of additional additives or removal of
existing ones on an ongoing basis".
